# Description: Goes through each statement within Task 00.
# Collaboration: I did not collaborate with anyone.

# 1/4 = .25
print(1/4)

# 1//4 = 0
print(1//4)

# int(1/4) = 0
print(int(1/4))

# 1//4.0 = 0.0
print(1//4.0)

# 4//2.5 = 1.0
print(4//2.5)

# -1//2 = 0.0
print(-1//2)
# I was wrong about this one. I assumed that after getting to -0.5, the value would be rounded to 0, not -1.
